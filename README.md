## ðŸ“Š Overview
This project presents an HR Analytics Dashboard designed to provide insights into workforce data and support data-driven decision-making. The dashboard helps HR teams track key metrics, identify trends, and improve organizational efficiency.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
**Employee Count:** The HR department lacks visibility into the total number of employees, making it challenging to assess workforce size and plan for future growth or downsizing effectively.

**Attrition Count:** The organization lacks a standardized method to track employee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organization.

**Attrition Rate:** Without a clear measure of attrition rate, the organization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarks, hindering the ability to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement.

**Active Employees:** The organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing the current workforce's productivity and capacity.

**Average Age:** The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees, making it difficult to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and
retain younger talent.


## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Excel / SQL** (for data cleaning and preparation)
